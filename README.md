# TensorFlow-and-TensorBoard

In this project, what we're going to be talking about is TensorBoard.

TensorBoard is a handy application that allows you to view aspects of your model, or models, in your browser. It's very useful if you want to show your results quickly in an interactive way in POC for example. Moreover, TensorBoard produce visual very easy to understand, even for non-initiate.

I'll loading some data, preprocessing her, build my CNN model and after all that, I explain how to setup TensorBoard and how to use it to view different aspect of your model in real time.

In my repository, you could find my script if you want to run my model on your computer easily and quickly.
